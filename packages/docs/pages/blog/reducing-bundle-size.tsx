          One of the biggest differentiators between Bedrock UI and other UI libraries is it's size.
          Bedrock UI's Javascript bundle clocks in at around 3kb gzipped, and the CSS bundle is
          typically around 5kb gzipped.

          To demonstrate the bundle size and render time savings, lets look at a website that was
          originally built with Material UI, and then re-written to use Bedrock UI. The website is a
          simple weather app that displays a 10 day forecast for a local area, along with some other
          information in a graphical format like cloud coverage and chance of precipitation. This
          website is open source and available on{' '}

          Bedrock UI delivers less Javascript and takes less time to render the application. Even
          considering the additional ~5kB of CSS, the download size and load time of Bedrock UI is a
          healthy boost over Material UI. When building applications for the web, size matters, and
          this example highlights that Bedrock UI can provide significant improvements in size and
          performance while still providing many of the same building blocks.

          We hope that Bedrock UI can grow to become another tool in the toolkit for developers
          building for the web. With many components and responsive breakpoints built in, we think
          that Bedrock UI is a competitive library for building great UIs. Bedrock UI will continue
          to grow and expand with new functionality, while maintaining its small footprint. We are
          committed to the growth of this library and hope it can continue to provide a lightweight,
          performant solution for building UIs.
